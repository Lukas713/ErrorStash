# Dashboard Errors Spec

## Overview

Replace the dummy errors data displayed in the main area of the dashboard (right side), with actual data from the database. It should look how it does now with the list of errors, but instead of using data from @src/lib/mock-data.ts, it should be from our Neon database using Prisma.

## Requirements

- Create src/lib/db/errors.ts with data fetching functions
- Fetch errors directly in server component
- Keep the current design. You can also reference the screenshot
- Update errors stats display
